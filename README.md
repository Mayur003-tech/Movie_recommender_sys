# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System  

## 📌 Overview  
This is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using **Python and Streamlit**, leveraging the **TMDB dataset** and **ML techniques** to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system analyzes movie metadata and suggests similar movies based on content-based filtering.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Recommend movies based on user preferences  
✅ Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** for recommendations  
✅ Interactive and user-friendly UI with **Streamlit**  
✅ Clean and structured dataset preprocessing  
✅ Deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** for easy access  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Preprocessing)  
- **Scikit-learn** (ML Models)  
- **Streamlit** (Web UI)  
- **TMDB Dataset** (Movie Data)  
- **Deployed on Streamlit Cloud**  

## 📊 Dataset  
The model is trained on the **TMDB dataset**, which contains metadata like movie titles, genres, overviews, and more. The dataset is preprocessed by:  
🔹 Removing missing values  
🔹 Tokenizing and vectorizing text data  
🔹 Implementing **TF-IDF** for content-based filtering
